# Setting Up an EC2 Instance with IAM Role

## Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
3. Click **Launch Instance**.
4. Configure the following:
    - **Name**: Provide a name for your instance.
    - **AMI**: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).
    - **Instance Type**: Select the desired instance type (e.g., t2.micro).
    - **Key Pair**: Select or create a key pair for SSH access.
    - **Network Settings**: Configure VPC, subnet, and security groups as needed.

## Step 2: Create an IAM Role
1. Navigate to the **IAM Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Click **Roles** > **Create Role**.
3. Select **AWS Service** and choose **EC2**.
4. Attach the necessary policies (e.g., `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` or custom policies).
5. Provide a name for the role and click **Create Role**.

## Step 3: Attach the IAM Role to the EC2 Instance
1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. Select your instance and click **Actions** > **Security** > **Modify IAM Role**.
3. Choose the IAM role you created and click **Update IAM Role**.

## Step 4: Verify IAM Role Access
1. SSH into your EC2 instance:
    ```bash
    ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<instance-public-ip>
    ```
2. Use the AWS CLI to verify access without running `aws configure`:
    ```bash
    aws iam list-users
    ```
    If the IAM role is configured correctly, you should see list of users.

## Notes
- Ensure the EC2 instance has internet access (via a public IP or NAT gateway) to communicate with AWS services.
- Use least privilege when attaching policies to the IAM role.
- Avoid hardcoding AWS credentials in your application.

## Step 5: Understanding Storage Options

AWS provides multiple storage options for EC2 instances. Below is a comparison of EBS, EIS, and EFS (including EFS-IA):

### Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- **Description**: Persistent block storage for EC2 instances.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for databases, file systems, and applications requiring low-latency storage.
- **Features**:
    - Attached to a single EC2 instance at a time.
    - Data persists independently of the instance lifecycle.
    - Supports snapshots for backup and recovery.
- **Performance Modes**:
    - General Purpose (gp2, gp3)
    - Provisioned IOPS (io1, io2)
    - Throughput Optimized (st1)
    - Cold HDD (sc1)

### Elastic Instance Store (EIS)
- **Description**: Temporary block storage physically attached to the host.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for temporary data like caches, buffers, or scratch data.
- **Features**:
    - Data is lost when the instance stops, terminates, or fails.
    - High IOPS and low latency.
    - Cannot be detached or reattached to another instance.

### Elastic File System (EFS)
- **Description**: Fully managed, scalable file storage for multiple EC2 instances.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for shared storage across multiple instances or applications requiring file system semantics.
- **Features**:
    - Accessible from multiple instances simultaneously.
    - Automatically scales to petabytes.
    - Supports encryption at rest and in transit.

### EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)
- **Description**: Cost-optimized storage class for files not accessed frequently.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for archival or less frequently accessed data.
- **Features**:
    - Lower storage costs compared to standard EFS.
    - Automatically moves files between EFS and EFS-IA based on access patterns.
    - Same durability and availability as standard EFS.

### Key Differences
| Feature                | EBS                     | EIS                     | EFS                     | EFS-IA                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Persistence**        | Persistent              | Temporary               | Persistent              | Persistent              |
| **Access**             | Single instance         | Single instance         | Multiple instances      | Multiple instances      |
| **Scalability**        | Fixed size              | Fixed size              | Automatic scaling       | Automatic scaling       |
| **Use Case**           | Databases, apps         | Caches, scratch data    | Shared storage          | Archival storage        |
